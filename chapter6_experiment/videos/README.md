## Video Naming Convention

Videos are named according to the experiment number and scenario variation:

- `experiment1.mp4` – Baseline gradient-based control with **static** passive agents
- `experiment1_mv.mp4` – Same as above, but with **moving** passive agents

> `_mv` suffix stands for “**moving**” variation

## Notes

- All experiments were conducted using a **Holybro X500 V2** with a **Pixhawk 6C** flight controller and **PX4 firmware**, onboard a **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B**.
- Recordings were made in a **controlled indoor environment** under strict safety precautions.
- Playback in Drive may lower resolution for streaming — download for original quality.
